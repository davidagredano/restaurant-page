# Restaurant Page â€” [Live Demo](https://davidagredano.github.io/restaurant-page/)

[![restaurant-page-preview](https://github.com/davidagredano/restaurant-page/assets/118218196/25fdeb47-0e42-4bd6-9e48-aa945e51c599)](https://davidagredano.github.io/restaurant-page/)

This project is part of The Odin Projectâ€™s JavaScript Course curriculum. It aims to apply everything learned in the immediate previous lessons, specifically **ES6 Modules** and **Webpack**, while continuing to practice **DOM manipulation**.

In this project, I dynamically render a restaurant homepage using **JavaScript only**, without any front-end frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular. The content pages (Home, Menu, Contact) function as tabs that render in the same URL, simulating a **Single Page Application (SPA)**. Users can navigate through the different sections by using the navigation buttons to select the content to be displayed.

## **Features**

- **Dynamic Content Loading:** The entire website content is dynamically generated using JavaScript, with no hardcoded HTML for the main sections.
- **Modular Architecture:** The project leverages ES6 modules, allowing for a clean and maintainable codebase by separating functionality into distinct modules.
- **Component-Based UI:** The UI is broken up into components, each separated into its own module. Every component is a JavaScript function that returns a DOM element or a Fragment, which is then appended to the corresponding HTML content container on demand.
- **Webpack Configuration:** Utilizes Webpack for bundling JavaScript modules and managing assets. The `webpack.config.js` file includes the specification of an *entry point* file and an o*utput* directory, *CSS loaders* for handling CSS files, *asset loaders* for managing image files, and *HtmlWebpackPlugin* for automatically generating an HTML file that includes the bundled JavaScript.
- **Single Page Application (SPA):** The site behaves like an SPA with different content pages (Home, Menu, Contact) rendered on the same URL. Navigation between these pages is seamless and handled via JavaScript.
- **Event-Driven Interface:** Implements event listeners for navigation buttons to handle tab switching and content rendering dynamically.
- **Custom Design:** The entire website was designed by myself using Figma, following a comprehensive workflow. This included requirements definition, sitemap creation, content modeling, content creation, wireframing, high-fidelity mock-up creation, and interactive prototype development.
